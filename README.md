# NeuralLift-360: Single Image to 3D Reconstruction

NeuralLift-360 is a state-of-the-art framework that transforms a single 2D image into a 3D object with 360° views, leveraging advanced neural rendering techniques. This project is optimized for resource-constrained environments and focuses on balancing computational efficiency, output fidelity, and stability.

## Introduction
NeuralLift-360 addresses the challenge of reconstructing a 3D model from a single 2D image, a problem critical for applications in:
- Virtual and Augmented Reality
- 3D Content Creation
- Gaming
- Automated Design

By integrating **Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining (CLIP)** and **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)**, NeuralLift-360 provides realistic texture and geometry reconstruction with efficient resource utilization.

---

## Features
- Converts a single 2D image to a fully rendered 3D model.
- High-fidelity textures and geometry with minimal artifacts.
- Optimized for Google Colab and T4 GPUs.
- Customizable hyperparameters for performance tuning.
- Supports batch processing and scalable configurations.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NeuralLift-360.git
cd NeuralLift-360
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
1. Prepare your input image and place it in the `inputs/` directory.
2. Run the main script to start the 3D reconstruction:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input inputs/sample.jpg --output outputs/
   ```

For advanced users, configure parameters in `config.yaml` to customize the pipeline.
